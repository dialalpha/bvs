2012-10-24:
	NEW: hotswap support
		hotswap support has been added to bvsd (a call: hs|hotswap <moduleID>
		and the run script got a fifo to control bvsd (see Readme.txt)
	NOTE: in order to use hotswapping with already existing modules, the
		'bvsHotSwapModule(...)' function will need to be added to it
		(located in 'libbvs/module/BVSExampleModule.cc')

2012-10-23:
	NEW: cmake->BVS_MODULE_HOTSWAP
		add module hotswapping, this is extremely experimental and must only
		be used in a development environment, modules that will be hotswapped
		can and will segfault due to an unlimited amount of reasons, use at
		your own risk and NEVER expect it to work ;-) (read the documentation
		in BVS::Loader for some hints on segfault mitigation)

2012-10-16:
	NEW: cmake->COMPILER_WARNINGS_MACRO
		add 'disable_compiler_warnings(...)' macro to disable pedantic
		compiler flags for certain source files (usually not one's own ;-),
		some times it might be necessary to aditionally use
		'include_directories(SYSTEM ...)' to really remove all of them

2012-10-12:
	CHANGED: submodule setup
		setup will now ask which submodules shall be installed, this will
		create a commit which must NOT be pushed back to the development
		repository as this will break existing installs for others

2012-10-02:
	NEW: cmake->BVS_GCC_VISIBILITY
		uses gcc's visibility feature for dynamic library symbol exports (read
		cmake info)
	NEW: cmake->BVS_LOG_SYSTEM
		now the log system can be enabled in cmake, if disabled, the log
		system's backend won't even be compiled and the created logger
		instances will have no functionality

2012-10-01:
	NEW: cmake->BVS_THREAD_NAMES
		allows threads to set names (read cmake info)

2012-09-30:
	NEW: module pools
		allow to setup module pools, meaning that a number of modules are
		executed by one single thread
		WARNING: not yet thoroughly tested, but should work fine

2012-09-28:
	NEW: ./run --update function to update without loosing local changes
	CHANGED: config usage
		please read the Readme.txt:USAGE, to migrate to the new system, please
		move your configs to a different location, run cmake in your build
		directory, that will setup the links to the config files from the
		modules, then you can just move/copy your configs to the existing
		symlinks, that will override the configs in their original places and
		your all setup to use the new system
