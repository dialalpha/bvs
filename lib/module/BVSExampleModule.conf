# This is an example config file for BVSExampleModule.
#
# For more information on syntax as well as further capabilities, please see
# 'lib/include/bvs/config.h' or 'DOXYGEN:Classes->BVS::Config'.

# It will be linked to [build/]bin/BVSExampleModule.conf so you can get
# started right away.
#
# This is a section/configuration header.
# It can be used to create 'configurations' of your module, simply by creating
# various sections with different options belonging to them. These are selected
# by using them as a uniqueID in bvs.conf when adding modules to the system (if
# you use 'conf.id + ".option"' to retrieve them), or by adding them after the
# library name, e.g.:
# modules += uniqueID(BVSExampleModule)...
# modules += uniqueID(BVSExampleModule.configuration)...
#
# [uniqueID]
# # please comment your settings
# option = value
