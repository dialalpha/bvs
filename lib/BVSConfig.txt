# list of modules to load
#
# full specification of a module line:
# modules [+]= [+|[poolName]]id[(library[.configuration])][.connectorOptions]
#
# [+] -> append the module list
# [+|poolName] -> load module inside its own thread ('+') or add/create to a
#             module pool of name '[poolName]' which also runs inside its own
#             thread and executes added modules in the given order
#             NOTE: 'poolName' must be inside '[...]', '+' must not
# [(library...)] -> use as module library, useful more multiple modules from
#                   one library
# [.configuration] -> use this configuration for the module, useful so the
#                     module name does not change but its configuration does
# [.connectorOptions] -> options for connectors, look as follows:
#                        input(test.output)[.input2(test.output2)]...
#
# if configuration and/or library are not given, the system will use the given
# id instead
#
# examples:
# modules = id(library)
# modules += +id2(library2).input(id.output)
# modules += +id3(library2.configuration).input(id2.output)
# modules += [pool]id4.input(id3.output)
